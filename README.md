Hello there!

My name is Josias Maldonado and I am a computer science student. I have a passion for Nissan vehicles and motorsports. A quote that I like to ponder on comes from King David of Israel circa 1000 BC. "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
